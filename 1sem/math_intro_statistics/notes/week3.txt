Exercise 2.9
The normal distrubtion is used in all 3 examples
a)
 for a continious Stocastic Variable
  probability density function(pdf): Integral( P(A) <= X <= P(B) ) 
    the chance for hitting an interval between 2 
    f(x)

  cumulative density function (cdf): Integral(-infinity, x)
     F(x)
  
 pnorm(2)
    the chance of a hit, from -infinity w. my = 0 & sd = 1

 pnorm(2,1,1)
    we use a cdf, as our mean is closer to infinite, the average chance of cdf occuring is less than the mean of 0.
 
 pnorm(2,1,2) 
    because the standard variation increases, the bell curve flattens, as such the area past the limit (2) becomes higher,
    decreasing the chance of a "hit" occuring

b)
    qnorm - returns decimal value that represent a %
    pnorm - returns a %
    qnorm(pnorm(x)) is x, 

c) 


Exercise 2.10
 1. true
 2. true
 3. false, sigma^2 is 4
 4. true (check)
 5. true - the tails are infinite, but the area is limited
 6. ????????

b)
 pnorm(20, 24, sqrt(16))
 1-pnorm(29.5, 24, sqrt(16))
 since the integral of a specific value is 0, it gives 0

exercise 2.11

 a)
    we wish to combine the bell curves
    a.1 difference of mean -> we need the difference of mean
    a.2 combination of variance -> when combining two bell curves, their spread(var) is added together

 b) 
    sammenlagte linære funktioner, find my: SUM(MY), (i.e. SUM(100, 65))
    sammenlagte lineære funktioner, find variance: SUM(var)


exercise 2.12
 a)
   the pdf requires integral(2993, 3007) we find the chance for this occuring by: 
   x = P( X <= 3006) - P( X >= 2993)
   pnorm(3007, mean,stdiv) - pnorm(2993, mean,stdiv)
   now to find the chance of it not happening:   
   1 - x //0.01963066;


exercise 2.13 
 a)
   1) reduce to lambda_30_min, 2) find the chance of it not occuring P(0, lambda_30_min) 
   1) x <- ((110000 / 365) / 24 / 60) * 30
   2) P(0, x) = 0.00187614
